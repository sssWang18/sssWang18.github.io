- ###  Full time research internship for learning, understanding, developing, and optimizing computer vision models to complete intelligent solutions for pathological images at [***Thorough Images***](http://thorough.ai/).



### Responsibilities:	
- Apply the National Invention Patent as the inventor of an automated scoring system for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER-2) after immunohistochemical(IHC) staining, and will be deployed in Chinese hospitals(ongoing for front end).
- Use computer vision techniques realized by OpenCV, Skiamge libraries and models with various types of deep learning neural networks implemented by PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras libraries to preprocess, recognize, segment, and classify in the pathological images for various pathological examinations.
