Hi, this is Alan (王圣元)! I am a Junior student majoring mathematics and computer science at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) advised by Prof. [Andrew Beveridge](https://mathbeveridge.github.io/), and Prof. [Susan Fox](https://www.macalester.edu/~fox/). Recently, I am researching Medical Image Segementation and Health NLP.

[[Curriculum Vitae]](https://sssWang18.github.io/files/CV.pdf)

My primary research interest lies in designing, developing, optimizing, and deploying *SAFE* deep reinforcement learning algorithms as well as their underlying mathematical principles to build autonomous (embodied, multi) agents that can perform in dynamic environments, solving real-world puzzles for common good. 

I also love competing in various competitions about mathematics modeling, programming design and cyber safety to unveil the elegant beauty of the mathematics and computer sciecne. In my spare time, I love to see the great lakes driving four hours away from my school, and I indulge in Chinese calligraphy, playing basketball, hiking, pools, soccer, going fishing, e.t.c.. 

To know more about me, you could see my [Publications(scripts)](https://sssWang18.github.io/publications/), [Projects](https://sssWang18.github.io/projects/), [Experience](https://sssWang18.github.io/experience/), and [Honors](https://sssWang18.github.io/honors/). <!-- I am also making some notes, especially based on detailed mathematical proofs and my understanding, while lerning and researching about reinforcement learning in [Blogs](https://sssWang18.github.io/blogs/). -->

I am a highly passionate third-year Mathematics and Computer Science student at Macalester College with a solid background in both pure mathematics and applied mathematics involved with computer and data science. My primary research interest lies in designing, developing, optimizing, and deploying deep reinforcement learning algorithms as well as their underlying mathematical principles to build autonomous agents that can perform in dynamic environments, sovling real-world puzzles for social good. Recently, I am researching about reset-free models for reinforcement learning. I also love competing in mathematical competitions to unveil the elegant beauty of the mathematics. With proficient skills in <i>Python, R, Java, MATLAB, SQL, HTML, CSS</i>, I love using mathematical thinking to solve practical problems as well.

I love to see the aurora driving four hours away from my school, and I indulge in Chinese calligraphy, playing basketball, golf, ping-pong, soccer, going fishing, e.t.c. in my spare time.
