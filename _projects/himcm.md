This is the final paper for the *20th Annual High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM)*, problem A.<br>Using MATLAB, I built models to determine the required number of drones and every droneâ€™s initial location during the process. Any simple pictures or icons could be designed for the drone show by my MATLAB program.[View PDF](/files/2017HiMCM.pdf)





I built models to determine the required number of Drones and every Drone's initial location during the process, and applied mathematical methods to make sure the setting and flight route of every drone. Any simple pictures or icons could be designed for the drone show by my MATLAB program. Then our team describe the flight routes according to mathematical language, and finally wrote a two-page memo to the Mayor to report the results of our investigation and make a recommendation as to whether or not to do the aerial light show.
