**Abstract:** Comb-drive  devices  have  been  widely  applied  in  many  fields.  However,  the  application  of  high  frequency  sensor,  such  as  the rocket  chamber,  still remains problems. In this work, a finite element code was used for the design, optimization and visualization of a comb drive accelerator. In the simulation results, the post-optimization design has high performance in high frequency oscillation  operating  environment.  The  optimization is based on the ideal eigenfre-quency  and  Nelder-Mead  method.  The  3-D  working  conditions  are  realized  by  testing  and  comparing  the  time  and  frequency  domain  of  pre-optimized and  optimized  design  whose  frequency  ranges  from  2000  Hz  to  5000  Hz.  Finally,  the  electric  potential  and  capacitance  in  comb  drive  are visualized, which shows the better electric signals and displacements.
